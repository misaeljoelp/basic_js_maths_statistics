## Overview

### The challenge

I should be able to:
- Create a menu with html y css only.
- Insert a dropdown list using html y css.
- See hover states for interactive elements.

### Links

- Solution URL: [Github](https://github.com/misaeljoelp/basic_js_maths_statistics/tree/main)
- Live Site URL: [Github pages](https://misaeljoelp.github.io/basic_js_maths_statistics/)

## My process
- Then little things were added, like the drop-down list, the menu and the images. I tried up to three designs and one is left with the feeling that it should not stop there but rather continue improving what has been done.

- It can be frustrating when you can't move forward and have to search for information on the web, but then with the result the feeling of achievement is nice
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid Flexbox

### What I learned

- I practiced laying out text in HTML, using flexbox, grid.
- I have reaffirmed my knowledge in HTML and CSS.
- I have learned to start a project without fear of stopping due to the difficulties it entails.

### Continued development

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.

- Use responsive design with the mobile first methodology.
